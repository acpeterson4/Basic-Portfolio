        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p> I am enrolled in a coding boot camp at Northwestern University and I am dedicating 2017 to pursuing my dream job as a full stack engineer. Before Northwestern I was a student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison; One of the many great experiences I had there is that I became fluent in speaking, reading, and writing Chinese.   </p>

		<p> Major technological changes are inevitable, and I want to work with people who are just as passionate and competitive as me to make them. </p>
